        The initial sharp increase in countries providing services for victims
        of human trafficking may be a result of the adoption of the United Nations
        adoption of the Palermo Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking
        in Persons, especially Women and Children in 2000. Up until this point,
        human trafficking had not been formally defined on the international stage.
        However, even 17 years following its adoption, most countries continue to lack
        services for victims. It is yet unclear as to why recent years have demonstrated
        somewhat of a plateau – or perhaps even a reversal – in progress on this front.

        The <strong>3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index</strong> was developed through the European Union,
        and aims to quantify the extent to which each country adheres to the requirements
        set forth by the United Nations Palermo Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish
        Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. Countries are given a score
        ranging from 1 (no compliance) to 5 (full compliance) on each of the following dimensions,
        for a total possible score of 15:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prosecution of perpetrators of human trafficking</li>
          <li>Prevention of human trafficking</li>
          <li>Protection of human trafficking victims</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        The <strong>Human Development Index</strong> was developed by the United Nations,
        and evaluates life expectancy at birth, average years of schooling,
        and gross national income per capita.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tracking between these two indices may suggest that those countries
        with the resources to foster strong HDI scores are better equipped to
        comply with the Palermo Protocol. However, the variability in this trend
        is perhaps more interesting: why would two countries with similar HDI
        scores – even two countries in the same global region – differ in their
        willingness or ability to properly address human trafficking?

        With a large majority of foreign victims entering the U.S. through the south,
        it makes sense that the largest number of human trafficking lawsuits has
        occurred in the south. However, the fact that sex trafficking cases greatly
        outnumber labor trafficking cases may be problematic. A 2005 study by the
        International Labour Organization found that less that half of worldwide
        trafficking victims are victims of sex trafficking. Either the U.S. diverges
        from that trend, or labor trafficking cases are not making their way to the
        courts for one reason or another.

        HumanTraffickingData.org documents 869 human trafficking lawsuits over
        the course of the past two decades, involving 7,050 victims. Approximately
        20% of those lawsuits involved foreign victims – comprising 66% of the
        7,050 total victims. Many of these victims come from Latin America and
        the Caribbean. Among the victims whose entry point into the United States
        is known (which is not always the case), nearly 70% were forced into the
        U.S. via the southern border. A variety of legal and illegal methods are
        utilized in order to do so, including smuggling, legal visas, and fake
        identification.

        While many of these rankings demonstrate fairly large year-to-year changes,
        Alaska and South Dakota stand out as having experienced the largest decrease
        and increase, respectively, in human trafficking cases since 2000. It is not
        immediately clear whether these shifts are primarily the result of changes
        in human trafficking patterns or changes in enforcement. It should also be
        noted that some states demonstrate relatively large jumps up and down the
        rankings, while others have remained fairly consistent over time. The reasons
        for this are yet unknown.

      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/sentences_by_race.png">
      <p><br>
        Perpetrators of any crime should receive similar sentences regardless of
        their own race or that of their judge. This doesn’t appear to be the case
        for human trafficking. While the lengthier sentences received by Black
        defendants may be the result of the same racial bias that affects sentencing
        for other crimes, the variation in sentencing based on the race of the
        judge is perhaps more unusual. The median sentence delivered by Asian
        is significantly lower than that of other judges
      </p><br>

        Two areas have deviated from the norm in terms of the volume of human
        trafficking cases they have processed since 2000: South Dakota,
        and Washington, D.C. While other states have processed significantly
        more cases in an absolute sense, controlling for population brings
        these two areas to light. It is again not immediately clear whether
        this pattern is driven by differences in enforcement or by actual
        trafficking patterns, though an initial search brings up articles
        like “Why sex traffickers love South Dakota” and “Washington D.C.’s
        serious sex-trafficking problem”.

        Non-American victims of human trafficking in the U.S. are most likely
        to be trafficked from Latin America and the Caribbean. In fact, more
        foreign victims of human trafficking in the United States come from
        Jamaica than any other country – regardless of population.
